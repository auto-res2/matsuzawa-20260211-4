  name: pr-autocot
  type: proposed
  description: "Paraphrase-Robust Auto-CoT with semantic robustness scoring"
  
  # Diverse candidate selection (Auto-CoT standard)
  clustering:
    method: kmeans
    vectorizer: tfidf  # or sbert
    k: 8  # number of representative questions/demos
  
  # Self-consistency scoring
  self_consistency:
    num_samples: 5  # m stochastic solutions
    temperature: 0.7
  
  # Paraphrase-consistency scoring (novel component)
  paraphrase_consistency:
    num_paraphrases: 3  # P meaning-preserving paraphrases
    temperature: 0.3  # low temp for paraphrase solving
  
  # Reliability weighting
  reliability:
    combining: sqrt_product  # sqrt(s_i * p_i), or "min" for ablation
    threshold: 0.5  # τ: keep demos with w_i >= τ
  
  # Final inference
  inference:
    strategy: greedy  # greedy decoding for test questions
    temperature: 0.0
